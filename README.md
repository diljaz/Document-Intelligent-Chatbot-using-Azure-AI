# Document Intelligence Chatbot Using Azure AI

This project leverages Azure OpenAI and Document Intelligence to create a chatbot that can load documents and answer queries regarding the content. The application utilizes libraries such as Flask, Streamlit, and FAISS for its functionality. The chatbot is designed and implemented using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, with enhanced functionality through the integration of document intelligence capabilities and response automation utilizing Azure AI services.
